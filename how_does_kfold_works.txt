How does K fold works?



Purpose of K-Fold cross validation is to evaluate new model performance on unseen data only.

So how K-fold works?

       - Model gets trained with training data.
       - Split the cross validation data set in to K-Folds(or K equal parts).
       - Get the hyper-parameter from the step-1 and train a new model with K-1 folds.
       - Evaluate step-3 model using left over Kth fold.
       - Repeat the process K times.
       - Take mean value of accuracy.

So we need a score of all K folds for model evaluation.
