Let's talk statistics:

- Correlation vs causation

- Standard deviation and measures of dispersion

- Mean vs median

- Random variables

- Expected values and variance

- p-values (now this one is massively misunderstood)

- Distributions

- GLMs

- Bayesian stats



Gaaargh! You can spend a lifetime learning this stuff! Anyway, pick your flavor below and learn you some statistics with an awesome Youtube session. Other suggestions are welcome.
