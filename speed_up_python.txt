6 tools to speed up your 
#Python code (with links)

ðŸ‘‰ Intel Distribution for Python - https://lnkd.in/gk6EB2P

Optimizes Python for Intel architectures using low-level, high-performance libraries like MKL. Can provide massive speedup for linear algebra routines and ML algorithms.

ðŸ‘‰ Numba - https://numba.pydata.org/

Just-in-time compiler (using LLVM) for Python. Replaces slow Python code with optimized machine code at runtime. Super easy to use.

ðŸ‘‰ swiftapply - https://lnkd.in/gFK285E

Automatically vectorizes apply calls, or replaces them with the best alternative.

ðŸ‘‰ Dask - https://dask.org

Provides parallelism for analytics by extending arrays, dataframes, and lists to "parallel" versions that are ready for distributed environments, plus provides a dynamic task scheduler.

ðŸ‘‰ Cython - http://cython.org/

Compile Python into C extensions. General use tool that can have more flexibility and power than simpler alternatives, at the cost of difficulty.

ðŸ‘‰ PySpark - https://lnkd.in/gRjExzR

Runs Python code on distributed Spark clusters. Great for processing big data sets.
