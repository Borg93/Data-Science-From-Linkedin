Tableau Integration with R 

As I recently work on a client project, I integrate R with Tableau and created some predictive models with several R packages. I found the process was easier than I expected. 

I recommend this feature to people who are proficient with R and R functions and would like to expand the horizon of data visualization (or save yourselves some time). 

Users who are already proficient with R will find the integration beneficial for several reasons:

They will be able to do statistical analysis on their Tableau data.
They will be able to access any R package or function that has been installed in an R server which they can access.
They will be able to take advantage of all of the visualization capabilities in Tableau to further analyze and understand their data without having to manipulate their data in R (which can be cumbersome) for the same effect.
